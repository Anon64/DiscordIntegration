#**DiscordIntegration**

This mod combines your Discord with your Minecraft server.

This is a server-side mod and therefore don't need to be on the client.

Forked from [Chikachi/DiscordIntegration](https://github.com/Chikachi/DiscordIntegration), I wanted to add some featured to this mod, but only the 1.12 version. Maybe I'll update the other versions if requested and I have time.

#### Changes compared to previous versions
